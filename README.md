# weather-app
<h1>React.js Weather app</h1>
<h2>Desciption</h2>
<p>The purpose of the project is to created a simple weather app using React.js to demonstarte my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. This app fetches users the weather information from the openweathermap.org using its api by searching the location.</p>
<h2>Installation and running</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Make sure Git is downloaded</li>
 <li>Open a terminal and type <code>git clone https://github.com/terry-lws/weather-app.git</code> to clone the repository</li>
 <li>Change the directory to a desired one and type <code>npm install</code> to install the required dependencies</li>
 <li>After installation, type <code>npm run start</code> to run the app</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use the app</h2>
<p>Simply enter the location you want to check weather on. For example, enter <b>Sydney</b>, the app will return the temperature, weather condition, humidity, pressure, visibility and wind speed of Sydney, AU.</p>
<p>In some occasions, their are multiple cities with the same name from different countries, in this case, enter the city name with the country code. For example, a user wants to look up the weather in Melbourne, Australia, they enter <b>Melbourne, AU</b>; if the country code is not typed in, the app returns <b>Melbourne, US</b> instead.
<p>If the app doesn't return anything upon entering, there might be an error with the spelling of the city or the city doesn't exsist.
<h2>Possible improvements</h2>
<p>The possible improvements of the app are listed below:</p>
<uL>
 <li>Replace the search bar with drop down menus that allow user to select cities and countries instead of typing in</li>
 <li>Add local time of the location</li>
</ul>
